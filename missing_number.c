/**
 * Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, 
 * find the one that is missing from the array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [3,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
 * Output: 8
 * Note:
 * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement 
 * it using only constant extra space complexity?
 *
 * 这题和前面一道First Missing Positive的题很像,不过那道题因为元素可能大于N,所以
 * 在思维上来说会很难想到.
